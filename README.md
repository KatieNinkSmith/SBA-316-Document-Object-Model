# SBA-316-Document-Object-Model

Instructions
You will create a small single-page web application. The topic and content of this application is entirely up to you; be creative!
Your work will be graded according to the technical requirements listed in the following section. Creativity and effort always work in your favor, so feel free to go beyond the scope of the listed requirements if you have the time.
Keep things simple. Like most projects you will encounter, you should finish the absolute minimum requirements first, and then add additional features and complexity if you have the time to do so. This will also help you understand what you can get done in a specific allotment of time if you were to be asked to do something similar in the future.
Once you have an idea in mind, approach your design through the user's perspective. User experience is one of the most important aspects of successful web design. If users enjoy their time on with your application, they are more likely to trust whatever services or information you offer, and more likely to come back and use the application again in the future.
Since topic and content are secondary to functionality for this assessment, we have included some resources below for free content that you can use to populate your application. Once you have gotten your functionality in place, you can return and fill in the content with something interesting.

PLANNING
Just one page
toggle light and dark mode is a simple option for an event listener and event handler functions with user interaction changing the style. I think ill use toggle to change color of the form background on the emergency form and ask are you sure you want to submit an emergency ticket.
make another page with a list that stores the name, phone, email and message. if they click send message it is added to the end of the list. if they click emergency message it is added to the top of the list highlighted yellow/red.

Requirements
x--Cache at least one element using selectElementById.
x--Cache at least one element using querySelector or querySelectorAll.
**loop and add nav bar** Iterate over a collection of elements to accomplish some task.
x--Create at least one element using createElement.
x--Use appendChild and/or prepend to add new elements to the DOM.
x--Modify the HTML or text content of at least one element in response to user interaction using innerHTML, innerText, or textContent.
x--Modify the style and/or CSS classes of an element in response to user interactions using the style or classList properties.
x--Modify at least one attribute of an element in response to user interaction.
x--Register at least two different event listeners and create the associated event handler functions.
Use at least two Browser Object Model (BOM) properties or methods.
x--Include at least one form and/or input with HTML attribute validation.
x--Include at least one form and/or input with DOM event-based validation. (This can be the same form or input as the one above, but should include event-based validation in addition to the HTML attribute validation.)
Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).
